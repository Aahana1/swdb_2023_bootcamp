# Visual Coding 2-photon

The Visual Coding 2-photon dataset is a survey of physiological activity in the awake mouse cortex. It was recorded using two-photon calcium imaging of neurons that were transgenically expressing a fluorescent calcium indicator, GCaMP6.

This dataset surveys responses from neurons in six different cortical visual areas including
'''
*VISp
*VISl
*VISpm
*VISal
*VISam
*VISrl
'''

```{note}
What are these visual areas? See [visual cortical areas](anatomy.md). 
```

The experiments leverage transgenic tools to drive the expression of the calcium indicators in specific populations of neurons. A total of 14 different transgenic lines were used, targeting different populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons across the different cortical layers.
